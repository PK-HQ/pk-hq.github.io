My goal is to restore meaningful vision in the blind by building next-generation light-based neuroprosthetics — one of the most ambitious and unresolved challenges in neuroscience. I lead a pioneering effort to reverse-engineer the neural code of the primate visual cortex using a read-and-write interface and biologically-constrained machine learning architectures. We've demonstrated that cortical stimulation triggers of feature perception beyond vague flashes of light in primates. This novel integrative approach redefines the frontier of visual neuroprosthetics — closing the gap between artificial stimulation and the fidelity of natural vision.

Prior to this, I worked on developing a [cortical neuroprosthetic](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165773) to enhance mobility in quadruplegic patients, and the [organization of the primate prefrontal cortex](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/43/38/6564.abstract) ([Libedinsky Lab](http://libedinskylab.com/) @ [The N.1 Institute for Health](https://n1labs.org/)). I also worked on unconscious visual processing and the [human brain transcriptome](https://www.eneuro.org/content/6/6/ENEURO.0283-19.2019) ([BAC Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/brainconsciousnesslab/about-us?authuser=0) @ [Duke-NUS Medical School](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/)). I received my B.S. in Biology (summa cum laude) at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/).

Stepping away from the technical complexities of research, my downtime often involves culinary creativity, kickboxing, and quality time with my cat.
