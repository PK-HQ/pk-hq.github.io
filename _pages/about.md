I'm a 5th-year Neuroscience PhD candidate in the [Seidemann lab](https://seidemannlab.site/) at [UT Austin](https://inp.neuroscience.utexas.edu/). My goal is to restore meaningful vision in the blind by building next-generation light-based neuroprosthetics - one of the most ambitious and unresolved challenges in neuroscience. I currently lead a pioneering effort to reverse engineer the neural code of the visual cortex using novel machine learning architectures, and to exploit its circuitry with light-based imaging and stimulation to generate more realistic perception in primates (versus electrophysiology-based implants). This integration of optical imaging and stimulation with machine learning allows us to engineer visual neuroprosthetics with real-world utility in the near future.

Prior to this, I was a research assistant in the [Libedinsky Lab](http://libedinskylab.com/) at the [The N.1 Institute for Health](https://n1labs.org/). I worked on developing a [motor cortex brain-machine interface](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165773) to enhance mobility in quadruplegic patients, and the [functional parcellation of the macaque lateral prefrontal cortex](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/43/38/6564.abstract). I was also a research assistant in the [Brain & Consciousness Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/brainconsciousnesslab/about-us?authuser=0) at [Duke-NUS Medical School](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/), where I worked on unconscious visual processing in humans and [integrating human neuroimaging and transcriptomics](https://www.eneuro.org/content/6/6/ENEURO.0283-19.2019) to identify drug targets associated with cognitive functions. I received my B.S. in Biology (summa cum laude) at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/).

When I'm not thinking about research, I enjoy cooking, kickboxing and the company of my cat.
