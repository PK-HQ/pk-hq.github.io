My goal is to restore meaningful vision in the blind by building next-generation light-based neuroprosthetics — tackling one of the most ambitious challenges in neuroscience. I lead a pioneering effort in the [Seidemann Lab](https://seidemannlab.site/) to reverse-engineer the neural code of the primate visual cortex (V1), leveraging a novel [read-and-write interface](https://pk-hq.github.io/projects/1_project.html) (simultaneous calcium imaging and optogenetic stimulation) powered by [biologically-constrained machine learning architectures](https://pk-hq.github.io/projects/2_project.html). In a breakthrough discovery, we demonstrate that stimulation of cortical V1 columns reliably triggers orientation perception, beyond primitive flashes of light with current cortical neuroprosthetics. This integrative approach redefines the frontier of visual neuroprosthetics — closing the gap between artificial stimulation and high-fidelity natural vision.

Prior to this, I worked on developing a [cortical neuroprosthetic](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165773) to enhance mobility in quadruplegic patients, and [functionally mapped the prefrontal cortex](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/43/38/6564.abstract) ([Libedinsky Lab](http://libedinskylab.com/) @ [The N.1 Institute for Health](https://n1labs.org/)). I also worked on unconscious visual processing and the [genetic signatures of cognition](https://www.eneuro.org/content/6/6/ENEURO.0283-19.2019) ([BAC Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/brainconsciousnesslab/about-us?authuser=0) @ [Duke-NUS Medical School](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/)). I received my B.S. in Biology (summa cum laude) at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/).

Outside of work, you can find me trying out new recipes, kickboxing, and spending quality time with my cat.
