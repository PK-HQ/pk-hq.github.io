I'm a 5th-year Neuroscience PhD candidate at UT Austin, advised by Prof. Eyal Seidemann. My goal is to restore meaningful vision in the blind by building the next-generation, light-based neuroprosthetic - one of the most ambitious and unresolved challenges in neuroscience. I currently lead a pioneering effort to reverse engineer the neural code of the visual cortex using novel machine learning architectures, and to exploit its circuitry with light-based imaging and stimulation to generate more realistic perception in primates (versus electrophysiology-based implants). This integration of optical imaging and stimulation with machine learning allows us to engineer visual neuroprosthetics with real-world utility in the near future.

Prior to this, I was a research assistant in the Libedinsky Lab at the N.1 Institute, Singapore. I worked on developing a brain-machine interface implanted in the motor cortex targeted at quadruplegic patient applications, and the functional parcellation of the macaque lateral prefrontal cortex. I was also a research assistant in the Brain and Consciousness Lab at Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, where I worked on unconscious visual processing in humans and integrating human neuroimaging and transcriptomics to identify proteins associated with cognitive functions. I received my B.S. in Biology (summa cum laude) at the National University of Singapore.

When I'm not thinking about research, I enjoy cooking, kickboxing and the company of my cat.
