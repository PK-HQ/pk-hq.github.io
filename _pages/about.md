I am currently a 5th-year Neuroscience PhD candidate at UT Austin advised by Professor Eyal Seidemann. My goal is to restore meaningful vision in the blind by building a closed-loop, all-optical neuroprosthetic—one of the most ambitious and unresolved challenges in neuroscience. Here, I propose to reverse engineer the neural code of the visual cortex using novel machine learning architectures, and to exploit its circuitry with light-based stimulation to generate realistic perception in primates. I lead a pioneering effort that integrates optical imaging and stimulation with machine learning—engineering visual neuroprosthetics with real-world utility.

Prior to this, I was a research assistant in the Libedinsky Lab at the N.1 Institute, Singapore. I worked on developing a brain-machine interface implanted in the motor cortex, targeted at quadruplegic patient applications. I received my B.S. in Biology (summa cum laude) at the National University of Singapore.

When I'm not thinking about research, I enjoy cooking, kickboxing and the company of my cat.
