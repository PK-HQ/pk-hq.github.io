<p>
Existing visual neuroprosthetics provide inadequate solutions for blindness resulting from retinal or optic nerve damage (~20M people; Steinmetz et al., 2021 *Lancet Glob Health*). My project pioneers a next-generation, light-based neuroprosthetic interface for the primate V1. This enables simultaneous high-resolution widefield imaging (read) and precise stimulation of orientation columns (write), leveraging state-of-the-art neural reporters and actuators co-expressed in excitatory neurons (Marshel et al., 2019 *Science*). We demonstrate for the first time that stimulating approximately 20 columns is sufficient for feature perception (orientation) in behaving macaques. Building on this, we are developing a biologically-constrained ML encoder-decoder framework to reverse-engineer the neural code toward closed-loop neuroprosthetics.
